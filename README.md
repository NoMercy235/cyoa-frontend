# Rigamo

Rigamo brings some much needed attention to the world of stories told in the "choose your own adventure" style. Besides the usual ability to read such stories, Rigamo also allows its users to because authors and write something themselves.

## The Time Travelers Anonymous team

This whole idea started from the adventurous group of travelers founded on [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) and lead by the mighty warrior, Tuesday.

#### Disclaimer

I started this project as a means to have some sort of "portofolio" which shows some of the technologies I've dealt with, and the way I structure/build things. Therefore, it will almost always be a work in progress, since it mostly serves as a place for me to test out new technologies/architectures/stuff.
