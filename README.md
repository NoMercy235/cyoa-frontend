#### Disclaimer

I started this project as a means to have some sort of "portofolio" which shows some of the technologies I've dealth with and they way I structure/build things. Therefore, it will almost always be a work in progress, since it mostly serves as a place for me to test out new technologies/architectures/stuff.
